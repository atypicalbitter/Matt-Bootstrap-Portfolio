## Introduction

My goal with this portfolio was to be able to build a website using bootstrap that could take my prevoius portfolio and enhance how it looks and operates.

## About

I had an idea from my inital portfolio on how I wanted to build apon this style. 

This was my inital protfolio - ![Alt text](<Images/Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 21.32.22.png>)![Alt text](<Images/Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 21.32.57.png>)![Alt text](<Images/Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 21.33.07.png>)

I liked the colours I used and the lay out I wnated to keep similar but still focus on hitting the requirements for the project. 


![Alt text](<Images/Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 21.31.10.png>) So I drew up these 2 wireframes, one for for Mobile -

And my final site came out like this - ![Alt text](image.png)![Alt text](<Images/Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 21.36.29.png>)![Alt text](<Images/Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 21.36.42.png>)![Alt text](<Images/Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 21.36.58.png>)

I utlised the Icons feature for my Skills section and Contact section as I feel like this is a better more aesthically pleasing way to style items rather than to list text. I also added the box shadow feature to the footer when clicked so it 'glowed.' What I used the most throughout was the box shadow hover psuedo class to create a scrolling colour wash across some of the titles. This is something I was very happy with. 

I did have to change the order of some of the cards and items midway through the process of me buidling the site with bootstrap, and although this was a small hiccup, I learnt from this and feel comfortable in being able to comabt any issues such as that in the future.
